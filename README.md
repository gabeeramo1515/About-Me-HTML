 # Summary

 Hello, my names Gabriel but I go by Gabe. I spend my time on the computer or hanging with friends. I enjoy playing videogames and listening to all different types of music. I'm currently a senior at Brockton High School. 

 # Family

I hold family very close to me. I have a little brother who had just turned four as well as two other younger sisters (one from each side of my family).
